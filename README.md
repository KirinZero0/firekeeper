**Firekeeper** is an AI chatbot designed to interact with users via natural language, powered by **OpenAI Whisper** for Speech-to-Text (STT) and **GPT-4o-mini** as the AI model. It allows you to interact with the system using voice commands, making your experience smoother and more immersive.

## Features

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper API to convert speech into text, enabling hands-free interaction with the bot.
- **AI Chat Responses**: Uses **GPT-4o-mini** to generate human-like responses based on the given context.
- **Voice Commands**: Supports voice commands for actions such as controlling music, checking system status, opening ChatGPT, and more.
- **Firekeeper Theme**: Inspired by the Firekeeper from Dark Souls, bringing a touch of elegance and calm to your interactions.

## How It Works

1. **Voice Commands**: The system listens for commands and converts them into text using the Whisper API.
2. **Command Processing**: The bot checks the text for specific commands (like "open ChatGPT," "play music," etc.) and executes the corresponding actions.
3. **AI Chat**: If the command doesn't match any predefined actions, the bot responds with a carefully crafted response generated by GPT-4o-mini, delivering a unique experience every time.
